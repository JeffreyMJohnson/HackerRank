#### [Hash Tables: Ransom Note](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-ransom-note)
A kidnapper wrote a ransom note but is worried it will be traced back to him. He found a 
magazine and wants to know if he can cut out whole words from it and use them to create 
an untraceable replica of his ransom note. The words in his note are case-sensitive and 
he must use whole words available in the magazine, meaning he cannot use substrings or 
concatenation to create the words he needs.

Given the words in the magazine and the words in the ransom note, print Yes if he can 
replicate his ransom note exactly using whole words from the magazine; otherwise, 
print No.

#### [Strings: Making Anagrams](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-making-anagrams)
Alice is taking a cryptography class and finding anagrams to be very useful. We consider two 
strings to be anagrams of each other if the first string's letters can be rearranged to form 
the second string. In other words, both strings must contain the same exact letters in the 
same exact frequency For example, bacdc and dcbac are anagrams, but bacdc and dcbad are not.

Alice decides on an encryption scheme involving two large strings where encryption is 
dependent on the minimum number of character deletions required to make the two strings 
anagrams. Can you help her find this number?

Given two strings, a and b, that may or may not be of the same length, determine the minimum 
number of character deletions required to make  and  anagrams. Any characters can be deleted 
from either of the strings.
