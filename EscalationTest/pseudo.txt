32 byte aligned - 

4 - unsigned int -> number of entities

2 - unsigned short -> ID
2 - unsigned short -> Type
4 - float -> xPosition
4 - float -> yPosition
4 - float -> xForward
4 - float -> yForward
12 - byte -> padding

set offset to 0;
read 4 bytes and set unsigned int to Number of entites
increase offset by 4
loop number of entities times
	read 2 bytes and set unsigned short to id
	increase offset by 2
	read 2 bytes and set unsigned short to type id
	increase offset by 2
	read 4 bytes and set float to xPosition
	increase offset by 4
	read 4 bytes and set float to yPosition
	increase offset by 4
	read 4 bytes and set float to xForward
	increase offset by 4
	read 4 bytes and set float to yForward
	increase offset by 4
	increase offset by 12
